# Plant Disease Forecast
This project was created for <a href="https://ai.google.dev/competition"> Gemini API Developer Competition</a> in 2024. 

> The main idea is to forecast plant diseases based on weather conditions. To achieve this I collected the fruit diseases in a [Fruit disease names](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sndorburian/fruit-tree-disease-names) dataset and based on that I Used Google AI Studio with Gemini 1.5, temp 1 to generate disease parameters and I saved this in a [Fruit disease dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sndorburian/fruit-disease/data). I included *apple, apricot, cherry, grape, peach, pear* diseases.
